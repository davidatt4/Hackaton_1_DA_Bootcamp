David: Program to connect volunteers to farmers
In general the code is a bit confusing when using the modules, but OOP was properly used.
It has many files so it got a litle bit messy.
The file Hackathon.py, for instance is not a python code, but SQL.
There are parts of the code that are not being used like the flask applications.
the GUI was made with Tkinter and it look nice.
No API or JSON was used.
Python OOP:10/10
Modules: 8/10
Database:8/10
JSON/API:0/10
Overall: 6.5
